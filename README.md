## Introduction

At present, Goldman Sachs is right about the prevalence of an information overload deterring many from starting their personal finance journey. Our team emphasises very strongly on not showing meaningless graphs or incomprehensible finance jargon only leading to more confusion.

Mavis by Goldman Sachs was designed to provide the most relevant and beneficial information and advice to youths to personal finance success.

Mavis provides youths easily accessible educational resources, a customised personal finance dashboard, specially curated recommendations through the use of transparent financial models for portfolio optimisation and future planning, and a community leaderboard for friends to master personal finance together.
